Wallet Class and Inventory Class follow the first SOLID principle of SRP. They only perform and control task relating to
what they represent. The Wallet only deposits and withdraws money from the balance and only when there is money available
to withdraw. It keeps a running balance of how much money is in there. The inventory keeps tracks of a number of supplies,
as well as buying and using what is in the inventory.

The Item and its child classes follow the Liskove Substitution Principle as there is nothing the parent class can do that
the child class can't.
